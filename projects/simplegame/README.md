![Simple game of tic tac toe](https://github.com/robfatland/pythonbytes/blob/master/projects/simplegame/tictactoe.png "tic tac toe game in progress")


### Overview


The easiest way of creating a simple visual game that I know of uses the 'pygame' package. In order to
use it (via **import**) you will need a Python environment and you will need to have pygame installed.
See the PythonBytes coaches for help with this. 


Once you have that in place: Create a program that shows the board for the game you have in mind and
allows the player to make moves. In my example program (example.py) the game is tic tac toe.


### Details


As you work on building a game you will probably find out that all sorts of things can go wrong that
you didn't realize when you started out. Persevere!
