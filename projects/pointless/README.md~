Write a program in Python that runs properly but does something completely pointless.  This is a little bit easier than
most of these project ideas. Here is an example, but not a very inspired one...


```
for i in range(1000001):
    j = i + 43

print('ok I added 43 to every number from 0 to 1 million... that was prety pointless')
print(' ')
print('... oh you could do better???')
```


That's all there is to it.
