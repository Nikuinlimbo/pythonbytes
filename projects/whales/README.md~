# PythonBytes Project In-Depth


[Here is a link to this page.](https://github.com/robfatland/pythonbytes/tree/master/projects/whales#pythonbytes-project-in-depth)


### Overview


Here is a creature that lives in the ocean...

It is called a **humpback whale** and it is one species of the family of *baleen* whales. The other family is
the whales with *teeth*. Many whales, both baleen and toothed, create sounds underwater. We can record these
sounds, listen to them, think about them, and even make pictures of them like this one...

The idea of this project is to learn how a research scientist might look for and think about whale vocalizations
using underwater microphones.


### Details


To begin working on this project you will need access to a research environment. To do that follow these steps...


- Read over this page with your parent or sponsor and agree it is ok for you to get a (free) GitHub account
- Go to the website http://github.com and create a GitHub account using an email address that you can check
- Once you have verified your email address you will be able to log in to your GitHub account whenever you like
- Contact me (Rob) and tell me your GitHub user name. I do not need anything else; like **I do not need your password**.
- Wait however long I say and then go to this website: **http://portcormorack.cloudmaven.org**
- Sign in using your GitHub account
- Please let me know that you have successfully logged in to Port Cormorack. That is where you need to be to do this project.


Once you have gotten here I will add more information. 


By way of "What's going on?": Notice you are using your web browser to connect to Port Cormorack.  
Your browser is acting like a window into your very own mini-computer. 
This mini-computer will run Python programs for you; and it has a number of useful tools for you to use. 
For starters it will help you connect to underwater recordings of many whale calls.  
However I am setting you up as if you were a research scientist; so there are some 
new things for you to learn; starting with the GitHub account described above.
