# PythonBytes Project In-Depth


[Link to here](https://github.com/robfatland/pythonbytes/tree/master/projects/stargirl#pythonbytes-project-in-depth)


### Overview


A certain billionaire has trapped you, Stargirl, on a Tesla Roadster headed towards Jupiter. If you are very careful
you can use your last few ounces of rocket fuel to fine-tune your arrival. Use your computer (and some Python) to
predict the proper entry path that will put you on a gravity-assist slingshot escape trajectory back towards the 
earth. 


This project is not for the faint of heart; I would say it is advanced. One way to approach the programming
challenge is outlined below. As always it will be more rewarding if you use as little of these hints as 
possible; and as always it may help to consult with us, your Python Bytes coaches and teachers. 


### Details


The sketch of ideas goes like this...

- Work in only two dimensions plus time. 
- We will try to use Turtle graphics but we will need two separate displays
  - First display is the entire Jupiter system
  - Second display is the close approach to either Jupiter or one of its four moons
- We will need to be very good at calculating and drawing (with turtles) the sum of two vectors
  - There is a Python Bites worksheet Coil about this
- We will take the position of Jupiter as fixed. Jupiter will be the reference that does not move.
- We create four moons that revolve around Jupiter -- in orbit -- based on some simple rules
  - The moons must move properly
