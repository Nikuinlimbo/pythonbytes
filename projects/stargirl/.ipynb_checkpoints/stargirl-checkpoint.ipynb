    "\n",
    "This notebook covers ideas to help you create a stargirl Python program.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the project? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You are on a space ship (actually a **Tesla Roadster** bound for Jupiter. \n",
    "You have just a little rocket fuel left in your tank -- just a little bit -- so if you\n",
    "can figure out how to use it to alter your course you might be able to escape on a trajectory that takes you back to earth! \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to think about this? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I am a scientist and so are you. We will use real science methods for this project; why not? \n",
    "\n",
    "* Gravity works \n",
    "* If we don't know what to do: We guess!\n",
    "  * We can modify our guess later\n",
    "* If things look too complicated: We simplify!\n",
    "  * We can make things more complicated later\n",
    "  \n",
    "Our first step in simplifying will be to say that everything happens on a flat table-top. This means\n",
    "in two dimensions; so locations are a matter of two coordinates ```x``` and ```y```.  In actual space\n",
    "there are three dimensions... but the moons of Jupiter all lie in a flat plane so this is not a\n",
    "bad simplification. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where is Jupiter? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "At the origin.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How big around is Jupiter? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Radius = rJ.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```rJ = 20.```\n",
    "\n",
    "### How massive is Jupiter?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Mass = mJ.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```mJ = 10.```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How many moons does Jupiter have? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are their names? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Io, Callisto, Ganymede and Europa.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are their locations, masses and radii?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You figure that out.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where is my Tesla Roadster space ship? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You figure that out. I put mine coming in from the left side of the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What direction is the Tesla headed, and how fast? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can give your Tesla a velocity which is a little arrow or *vector*. The length of the arrow is how fast you\n",
    "are moving (your *speed*) and the two components of your arrow in the x-direction and y-direction form\n",
    "a right triangle. The velocity vector is the hypotenuse of this triangle. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does my space ship move? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "First we want to set up a clock as a for-loop so that time can advance. Then we want to move your space ship\n",
    "in little jumps, one jump per time step, using your velocity to guide where you go. We also want to make sure\n",
    "that we update the variable for where you are. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "for time in range(500):\n",
    "    time_tick = 1.0                             # 1 second\n",
    "    newposition = oldposition + velocity * time_tick\n",
    "    oldposition = newposition\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that this code won't work unless you establish ```oldposition``` and ```velocity``` ahead of time. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that you will always go in a straight line here; there is no gravity yet. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that velocity is not changed... your Tesla will continue in a straight line forever.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### That code looks like it is not two-dimensional\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "True... but you can make use of Python tuples like ```v = (x, y)``` so now you are working in two dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do I factor in gravity? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's write the same code as above (the time loop) but allowing the velocity to change...\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "for time in range(500):\n",
    "    time_tick = 1.0                            # 1 second\n",
    "    \n",
    "    velocity_change = some gravity Python that we have not written yet...\n",
    "    newvelocity = oldvelocity + velocity_change\n",
    "    \n",
    "    newposition = oldposition + newvelocity * time_tick\n",
    "    oldvelocity = newvelocity\n",
    "    oldposition = newposition\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that ```newposition``` is calculated just as it was before. The only difference is that we put in \n",
    "some additional code that allows the velocity to change with each time tick. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course there is something missing. The missing piece is precisely how the force of gravity \n",
    "changes the velocity. What is the 'gravity Python'?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do I see what I am doing? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Turtle graphics works great for this. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Draw a circle for Jupiter\n",
    "* Draw a circle for each of the moons\n",
    "* Move the turtle to the location of your Tesla\n",
    "* Put the pen down\n",
    "* Every time you calculate newposition make sure your turtle moves there\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do I know if I crashed into one of the moons? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If your distance to the center of a moon is less than the radius of the moon you are inside the moon.\n",
    "Unless you got very lucky and found a big hole drilled through the moon: You have crashed. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do I escape from the Jupiter system? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You could try a bunch of different velocity vectors and see how each one produces a different trajectory. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If gravity in your program is working properly: Each different velocity vector will produce a unique path\n",
    "for your space ship. You can select the one that you like the best... and even fine tune it if you like. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You could use ```input()``` statements to ask the Player to enter a position and a heading. Maybe keep the \n",
    "requirement that the Player enters from the left side of the screen, moving to the right. You could also give the \n",
    "Player the option of choosing how fast they are moving. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wait a minute... you never explained the ```gravity Python code```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "That is true. You can figure this out but you can also talk to the coaches about this key point. As a hint I will\n",
    "leave you with this equation which is for just one planet:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<big>$$velocity\\; change = \\frac{constant \\times mass \\;of \\;planet}{distance^2}$$"
