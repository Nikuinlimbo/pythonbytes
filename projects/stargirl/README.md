# PythonBytes Project In-Depth


[Here is a link to this page.](https://github.com/robfatland/pythonbytes/tree/master/projects/stargirl#pythonbytes-project-in-depth)


### Overview


A certain billionaire has trapped you, Stargirl, on a Tesla Roadster headed towards Jupiter. If you are very careful
you can use your last few rocket engine burns to take a gravity slingshot trajectory and escape back towards the 
earth. 


Normally you would read that description and think 'Oh goodie I get to play a computer game!' Not this time. This time
you get to **create** the computer game; and only then do you get to play it. However to make it a bit more fun we will
include the ability to play some music to entertain you as you write your code. 


### Details


The sketch of ideas goes like this...

- First we will work in only two dimensions. Space is 3D but let's keep it simple for now.
- We will try to use Turtle graphics but we will need two separate displays
  - First display is the entire Jupiter system
  - Second display is the close approach to either Jupiter or one of its four moons
- We will need to be very good at calculating and drawing (with turtles) the sum of two vectors
  - There is a Python Bites worksheet Coil about this
- We will take the position of Jupiter as fixed. Jupiter will be the reference that does not move.
- We create four moons that revolve around Jupiter -- in orbit -- based on some simple rules
  - The moons must move properly
