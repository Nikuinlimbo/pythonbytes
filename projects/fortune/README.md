# PythonBytes Project In-Depth


[Here is a link to this page.](https://github.com/robfatland/pythonbytes/tree/master/projects/bees)


### Overview

The **fortune** project is an extension of the magic eight ball. You are trying to give the person
running the program the impression that you (the computer) are all-knowing and all-seeing. You can
make this into a fortune-teller based on the person's birthday; or you could ask them some other
questions like 'what is your favorite color?' Once you have some information you can proceed to give
the advice along the lines of a fortune. 


The value of doing this project is that you will gain experience workin with strings returned by **input()**. 
You should begin by reading the **Details** section of the **Adventure** project which talks about how to
work with input like this. 


Remember to tell us (the club coaches) about your idea for a **fortune** project if you decide to give it a try.
