# PythonBytes Project In-Depth


[Here is a link to this page.](https://github.com/robfatland/pythonbytes/tree/master/projects/art#pythonbytes-project-in-depth)


### Overview


A number of Python Bytes students expressed an interest in art and design via computer. Often artists use special
creative Apps but here we are learning to program in Python; so you are the person creating (and using) the App. 


What sort of art might you create? One approach is to look for inspiration in the paintings of the 20th and 21st
century. You might for example use a search engine to find sources of **abstract art**. I found Piet Mondrian...

What about other Python Bytes projects? Take a look at the 
[image on the Stargirl project page](https://github.com/robfatland/pythonbytes/tree/master/projects/stargirl#pythonbytes-project-in-depth).
The 
[fractals-I](https://github.com/robfatland/pythonbytes/tree/master/projects/fractals-I#pythonbytes-project-in-depth)
and 
[fractals-II](https://github.com/robfatland/pythonbytes/tree/master/projects/fractals-II#pythonbytes-project-in-depth)
projects will also produce some interesting images for you to enjoy.


### Details


Let's take a moment to recreate the Mondrian piece shown above using the pygame package.
If it is not here yet please remind me to write the code. If it is done it will be 
called 'example.py'.
