# PythonBytes Project Ideas


[Here is a link to this page.](https://github.com/robfatland/pythonbytes/tree/master/projects#pythonbytes-project-ideas)

### On selecting a project
Below is a list of project ideas. Choose one to try out; modify it if you like; or make up one of your own.
The most important thing to remember as you read and think is: Check in with us so we can help make sure 
you are successful with your project.  To keep your project work from being confusing, impossible and/or 
discouraging you might look for something 'very easy' first. Often a simple-sounding project can be 
surprisingly fun and interesting.

### Project: Project Euler! 


**Many interesting project ideas can be found at [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)**


The **Project Euler** website has dozens of interesting programming challenges with mathematical themes. 
For example (Problem number 63): 

> The 5-digit number 16807 is also a fifth power: Seven raised to the fifth power. 
> Similarly, the 9-digit number 134217728 is also eight raised to the ninth power.
>
> How many n-digit positive integers exist which are also an n-th power?


Project Euler brings together your mathematical thinking (to help understand and evaluate the challenges) 
with your growing programming skills. Each project has a user-rating that you can see once you create an
account and begin to explore. A great feature is that you can submit your answers for evaluation.



### Project: Art Concepts


**You are an artist who uses computer graphics to produce graphical themes and patterns: Existing and new**


This is an abstract painting by Dutch painter Piet Mondrian.

The idea of this project is to research artists and artistic themes with the idea of creating similar graphical elements 
using Python. You might begin with Turtle graphics but there are many other ways you can proceed.  There are even 
[books](https://www.makeartwithpython.com/book/) devoted to making art using Python.


### Project: Bees and Drones


**A farmer wishes to use drones to locate some beehives on her orchard so she can cultivate them and have a better harvest.**


You are a farmer. You have an orchard 2000 meters x 2000 meters. Notice that locations in your orchard can be
represented using *(x, y)* coordinates. Your trees (they are baobab trees) go up quite high, as high as 30 meters; 
so we can think of the height above the ground as a third coordinate *z*. Hence a location in your orchard can
be written **(x, y, z)**. For example **(16, 12, 5)** would be a point 20 meters from the corner of the orchard and 
5 meters above the ground.  


Seeing a few bees buzzing about -- honey bees I should say -- you have determined that there are some bee hives 
in your orchard. However the tall trees make them hard to locate... but you have a small supply of drones that 
can travel to any location (x, y, z) in your orchard and count the number of bees there. The drone turns off its
propellers for a moment and uses a microphone to count the number of bees nearby. Then it flies back to your 
house and reports how many bees it found.


Unfortunately there is a small chance that your drone will get caught in a tree and be lost to you each time 
you send it out to count bees. (Perhaps the bees recover the lost drones and use them for their own purposes.
If you understand this joke please explain it to your parents.) 


To learn more about this project: Click up above on the folder *bees* and read on.

### Project: Converging Bugs


**You are observing some bugs placed on a table. They follow some rules for motion and your task is to simulate this.**


There is a famous math problem that can be solved using some logic. The idea here is to verify that the logical
solution is also what you would measure if you used a computer program to simulate how the bugs move. Because
this project is a lot of fun we encourage you to

### Project: Pi from Py


**There are many ways to calculate pi using a computer; so learn to build and compare them**


One of the most fundamental ideas in computer programming is the loop: Doing a task over and over again (each
time in a different way) until a much larger task is completed. Humans rapidly tire of such tasks since we are
busy with other tasks at the same time... like eating lunch and singing songs. So imagine if you will that some
mathematician has invented a sequence of fractions which is infinitely long. When added together these fractions
are equal to pi... which consists of an infinite number of digits. Using a computer you can calculate pi 
*approximately* by adding up tens of thousands of these fractions. How accurate is the result? 


This is an excellent starter project. You can

### Project: Knight's Tour


**You have a chessboard and a knight placed upon it. Find a path of legal knight moves that visits every square once.**


This is another famous problem that can be solved with a good choice of algorithm. It also usually takes the 
form of a recursion problem; so here is a note on recursion. Suppose you want to add 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2.
One way to do this is to write a Python function that can call itself. This is an advanced topic so you will 
want to talk to the Python Bytes coaches if you are not already familiar with it. 


Now to consider whether you want to try this project: First make sure you know how knights move across the board 
in the game of chess. Then think about how you would keep track of where the knight has visited (which squares) 
on its tour. For each move you must determine where the knight *could* possibly go next and which of those *possible*
squares have already been visisted. If the knight has no possible moves from a given square then your program must 
back up the knight up to where it can choose a different path. It is very much like walking through a maze that you
build as you go through it. When the knight backs up it should not try the same path as you already know that won't
work; so you must keep track of what you have already tried in some way. So there is quite a lot of logic involved 
in this problem and it is definitely a difficult programming challenge. But it is also very fun.

### Project: Room Escape 


**Create a text adventure where a player must determine the right series of steps to escape from a locked room.**


[More on adventure here...](https://github.com/robfatland/pythonbytes/tree/master/projects/adventure#pythonbytes-project-in-depth)


### Project: Game Player


**Create a program that plays a simple game like tic-tac-toe or Nim against a human.**


Creating simple computer games where the computer takes one side is a time-tested way of improving your programming 
skills. First you must create code that properly conducts the game; and then you must add some form of intelligence
so it plays well enough for the game to be interesting to the human player. Tic-tac-toe and Nim are two examples
of games but there are dozens more.

### Project: Solve a Sudoku puzzle


**Create a program that solves a Sudoku puzzle**


This project develops arithmetic and logic (Python) skills. If you are unfamiliar with Sudoku you
should learn about it and try some easy example puzzles first. Let's assume you have done so; now
how would you go about building a program that solves a Sudoku (instantly!). We describe one approach
here following the ideas of the great Jake VanderPlas. You can dive into the sudoku folder and read
the guidelines there... or you can begin right away without any hints and see how far you get. 


This is a fairly advanced project. You can

### Project: Video game


**Create an interactive video game using a Python package like [pygame](http://pygame.org)**


[More on video games here](https://github.com/robfatland/pythonbytes/tree/master/projects/videogame#pythonbytes-project-in-depth)


### Project: Fractals I


**Use a simple procedure called the *Chaos Game* to create a fractal structure with infinite permiter and zero area**


The Chaos Game uses a geometric plane with three (or *n*) points and a random number generator. You begin anywhere
and follow a simple rule to determine which of the points is your target. You move half-way to that target and draw
a small dot. Then you repeat the procedure a large number of times until a pattern emerges. Advanced programmers 
may choose to play the Chaos Game in three dimensions, for example in the world of Minecraft. 


[More on these fractals here](https://github.com/robfatland/pythonbytes/tree/master/projects/fractals-I#pythonbytes-project-in-depth)


### Project: Fortune Teller


**Create an interactive program: Ask the player some questions; then tell them something interesting.**


[More on fortune programs here](https://github.com/robfatland/pythonbytes/tree/master/projects/fortune#pythonbytes-project-in-depth)


### Project: Maze Solver


**Create a program that is able to find its way out of a maze.**


[More on maze solvers here](https://github.com/robfatland/pythonbytes/tree/master/projects/maze#pythonbytes-project-in-depth)



### Project: Fractals II



**Use the rules of complex arithmetic to create one of an infinite number of Julia Set fractals.**



[More on these fractals here](https://github.com/robfatland/pythonbytes/tree/master/projects/fractals-II#pythonbytes-project-in-depth)



### Project: Whale calls



**You study whales and their calls and you would like to try and talk to them.**



![humpback whale spectrogram](https://github.com/robfatland/pythonbytes/blob/master/projects/humpback_spectrogram.png "whale call")



[More on whale calls here](https://github.com/robfatland/pythonbytes/tree/master/projects/whales#pythonbytes-project-in-depth)



### Project: Minecraft landscapes


**Minecraft landscapes: You use four simple functions to build anything you can imagine in Minecraft** 


[More on minecraft here](https://github.com/robfatland/pythonbytes/tree/master/projects/minecraft#pythonbytes-project-in-depth)


### Project: Stargirl


**Stargirl: You pilot a Tesla Roadster to escape the Jupiter system.**


You might say 'Python is a bit tricky but it's not Rocket Science!' but indeed how wrong you would be. This project 
creates a game putting the Player at the controls of a Tesla Roadster that still has some gas in its rocket engines. 
You are approaching the planet Jupiter and must use some controlled burns to slingshot yourself away using the
Jupiter itself and the four moons: Callisto, Europa, Io and Ganymede. 


[More on Stargirl here...](https://github.com/robfatland/pythonbytes/tree/master/projects/stargirl#pythonbytes-project-in-depth)


This project would be quite challenging if you are new to gravity. If you have a lot of experience with
gravity you will have some helpful intuition; and we can always give you some further help; come see us!


### Project: Ditch Day Stack


**Ditch Day Stack: An advanced project for those who complete some other project and have time to do more.**


This is an advanced project for students who complete a project and have time to do more. The key idea to this project
is you have no idea what it is about to start with except for the three words 'ditch day stack'.
