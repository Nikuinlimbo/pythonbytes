### Overview


The ditch day project is pretty cool but you have to do some other projects first. Let us (the club coaches) know how you are 
doing and 'unlock' this project with your success and hard work!


### Details


'Ditch day' is a tradition at my undergraduate alma matter: Where seniors create puzzles for underclassmen to solve... and then
leave to spend the day at the beach.
