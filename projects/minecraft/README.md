### Overview


Once as you traveled through Minecraft you came upon a strange mist forming.

Soon it solidified into a certain genii who granted you magical powers in Minecraft.  



- You can determine where a player is located
- You can move the player anywhere
- You can determine what sort of block is in place: Anywhere
- You can place any sort of block: Anywhere


Now with great power comes great Python programs. Remember you know how to use loops and math. So how would you
create a mountain? A range of mountains? A lightning strike? A castle? A lake in the sky? Made of lava? 
A city made of glass? Portals to the nether world? 


This project is not for the faint of heart... and you will need to have a computer (other than your school
computer) to work on. Talk to Rob about this. You will need one PC, one Minecraft subscription, and some time
to put together your own special Minecraft server. We will walk you through all the steps; and then before
you know it you will be able to create anything you can dream up
