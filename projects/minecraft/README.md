# PythonBytes Project In-Depth


[Link to here](https://github.com/robfatland/pythonbytes/tree/master/projects/minecraft#pythonbytes-project-in-depth)


### Overview

Scroll down to see the results of the Python program on the main Projects page. But first... a story:


Once as you traveled through Minecraft you came upon a strange mist forming.

Soon it solidified into a certain genii who granted you magical powers in Minecraft.  



- You can determine where a player is located
- You can move the player anywhere
- You can determine what sort of block is in place: Anywhere
- You can place any sort of block: Anywhere


Here is a result of choosing and placing blocks somewhat at random (the code is on the main Projects page):

Now with great power comes great Python programs. Remember you know how to use loops and math. So how would you
create a mountain? A range of mountains? A lightning strike? A castle? A lake in the sky? Made of lava? 
A city made of glass? Portals to the nether world? 


This project is not for the faint of heart... and you will need to have a computer (other than your school
computer) to work on. Talk to Rob about this. You will need a PC or a Mac, one Minecraft subscription ($25 last I checked), 
and some time
to put together your own special Minecraft server. We will walk you through all the steps; and then before
you know it you will be able to create anything you can dream up
