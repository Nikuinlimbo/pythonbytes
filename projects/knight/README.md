### Overview

A chess knight hops two squares across plus one square over. A famous question is whether the knight can hop to each 
square of the 8 x 8 chessboard once in 63 moves; and the answer is 'Yes!'... but how? 


This project is an opportunity to explore recursive functions; which are functions that call themselves. 


Here are the first ten squares of a knight tour across an 8 by 8 chessboard.
